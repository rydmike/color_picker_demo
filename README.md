# color_picker_demo

Flex ColorPicker is a customizable color picker for Flutter. The ColorPicker can show six different types of color pickers, three of which are used for the standard Flutter Material colors and their shades. The size and style used for the pick items can be customized.

Flex ColorPicker is available as a published package on [pub.dev here](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_picker).

A web demo that shows the features of the ColorPicker [it is running live here](http://rydmike.com/democolorpicker). This the source code for the web ColorPicker demo app.

While this demo is a web version, the ColorPicker works very well on mobile devices and Flutter desktop builds too. One advantage of the **Flex ColorPicker** package is that it can be configured in many different ways to provide just the right amount of color picking features, with a style that fits with your application.
